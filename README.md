## Introduction

The Concurrent Design Platform 4 (CDP4) Webservices is the RHEA Group Concurrent Design REST API. The CDP4 is the RHEA Group Concurrent Design Solution that allows a team of engineers to perform Concurrent Design. The CDP4 is an implementation of ECSS-E-TM-10-25A Annex A and C. ECSS-E-TM-10-25A Annex A is the so-called master model that is expressed in UML. ECSS-E-TM-10-25A Annex C describes the REST API. 

Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/RHEAGROUP/CDP4-WebServices-Community-Edition/wiki) for detailed information on installation, architecture and much more.

## Concurrent Design

The Concurrent Design method is an approach to design activities in which all design disciplines and stakeholders are brought together to create an integrated design in a collaborative way of working.

The Concurrent Design method brings many advantages to the early design phase by providing a structure for this otherwise chaotic phase. Many design concepts have been implemented in the Concurrent Design method to help a team of stakeholders perform their task. The design work is done in collocated sessions with all stakeholders involved and present, creating an integrated design and enabling good communication and exchange of information between team members.

## CDP4-SDK

The Concurrent Design Platform 4 (CDP4) Webservices make use of the [CDP4-SDK](http://sdk.cdp4.org/).

## Web Framework

The CDP4 Webservices are built on top of the [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/). Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .NET and Mono. 

## ecss-10-25-annexc-integration-tests

The ECSS-E-TM-10-25 Annex C integration tests are used to validate the correctness of the implementation. These integration tests are available on [Github](https://github.com/RHEAGROUP/ecss-10-25-annexc-integration-tests)
